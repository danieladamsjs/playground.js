// Given a string, return its encoding defined as follows:

// First, the string is divided into the least possible number of disjoint substrings consisting of identical characters
// for example, "aabbbc" is divided into ["aa", "bbb", "c"]
// Next, each substring with length greater than one is replaced with a concatenation of its length and the repeating character
// for example, substring "bbb" is replaced by "3b"
// Finally, all the new strings are concatenated together in the same order and a new string is returned.
// Example

// For s = "aabbbc", the output should be
// lineEncoding(s) = "2a3bc".

function lineEncoding(s) {
  let count = 1;
  let result = "";

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (s[i] === s[i + 1]) {
      count++;
    } else {
      if (count > 1) {
        result = result + (count + s[i]);
      } else {
        result = result + s[i];
      }
      count = 1;
    }
